    "\n",
    "The optimized preprocessing provides an algorithm to mitigate potential bias of the training data and as well maintain the effectiveness of data. The algorithm is straightforward by seeing its optimization function, which consists of an objective function with two constrains, which corresponds to the three focuses of the algorithm: **Utility Preservation, Discrimination Control, and Distortion Control**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works good to reduce bias on the protected variables as a preprocessing technique. However, we may still have to sacrifice some model performance as we reduce discrimination. We would suggest that users should carefully choose a proper parameter to control the level of reduce of bias. For example, in some field where human is involved along with ethical issues, we may rather sacrifice model efficiency to get an unbiased model, while in other cases we may focus on the performance of the model instead.\n",
